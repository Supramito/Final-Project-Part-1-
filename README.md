# Final-Project-Part-1-

**Problem Statement**
Problem: "Assisting individuals with mobility impairments in navigating public spaces."
Description: Many people with mobility impairments face challenges in accessing public areas, such as parks, shopping centers, and transportation hubs. This can lead to social isolation and reduced quality of life.


**Existing Solutions:**
Robotic Wheelchairs: Some robotic wheelchairs can navigate autonomously, but they often lack the ability to interact with the environment effectively.
Service Robots: Robots like those used in hospitals can assist with navigation but are not designed for outdoor environments.
Smart Canes: These devices help visually impaired individuals but do not assist with mobility impairments.


**Key Insights:**
There is a need for a robot that can assist with navigation in various environments, providing real-time feedback and support.
Current technologies can be integrated to create a more comprehensive solution.

**Robot Concept Description**
Robot Name: "Mobility Assistant Robot (MAR)"
Functionality:
Navigation: The robot will use GPS and sensors to navigate public spaces, avoiding obstacles and providing directions.
User Interaction: It will have a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input destinations and receive audio or visual guidance.
Support Features: The robot will be equipped with a seat for users to rest if needed and a storage compartment for personal items.

**Prototype Development:** By the end of the course, I will use the VEX EXP kit and 3D printing to create a working prototype of the Mobility Assistant Robot.
Programming: The robot will be programmed to carry out navigation tasks and respond to user commands effectively.
